## Problem statement

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market.

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details.

As a data analyst, my role is to analyze the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends. 
The successful acquisition of this project depends on my ability to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations and impress Mr. Bashnir Rover & his team.

### Task List
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data to work on the following tasks.
- Design a dashboard with your metrics and analysis. The end users of this dashboard are top-level management and the product strategy team - hence the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
- Present your insights to stakeholders. Be creative and concise with your presentation.
- Use your dashboard in the presentation along with the deck.
- Use additional data based on your research to support your recommendations.

  ## New Things that I learned from this Project
- I Learned, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard were achieved using bookmarks and selection same as a website page navigation).

## Potential Decisions

1. **Tailored Credit Card Offers:** Design customized credit card programs specifically for the 25-34 age group, highlighting key spending categories such as bills, groceries, electronics and more. This initiative aims to engage a younger demographic and drive increased credit card adoption and usage..

2. **Marketing Campaigns for August and September:** Capitalize on the increased spending trends typically seen in August and September by implementing focused marketing campaigns during these months. Offering promotions, discounts, or rewards can enhance credit card usage and attract new customers.

3. **Diversify Credit Card Features:** Introduce credit card features and rewards to match the spending preferences of diverse age groups and genders. For instance, provide travel-focused benefits for women aged 25-34 who prioritize travel as a key spending category.

4. **Exclusive Credit Card for Salaried IT Professionals:** Design a dedicated credit card offering tailored benefits for salaried IT professionals, known for their high average monthly spending. Customize rewards, cashback, and loyalty programs to align with their unique needs and preferences.

5. **Promote Family-oriented Credit Card Features:** Capitalize on the higher spending observed in the 35-45 age group, especially for health and wellness. Introduce family-oriented credit card features, such as health insurance or wellness-related rewards, to appeal to this demographic.

6. **Targeted Marketing for Electronics Category:** Since Electronics is a prominent spending category, develop targeted marketing campaigns around the purchase of electronic goods. Offer discounts, extended warranties, or exclusive deals for credit card users in this category.

7. **Expand Credit Card Acceptance:** Work on expanding the acceptance of the bank's credit cards at more merchants and outlets. A wider acceptance network can encourage existing customers to use their credit cards more frequently and attract new users.

8. **Educational Campaigns on Credit Card Benefits:** Launch educational campaigns to inform customers about the benefits and advantages of using credit cards, particularly focusing on the advantages in Bills, Groceries, and Electronics categories. This can dispel misconceptions and encourage more customers to adopt credit card usage.
